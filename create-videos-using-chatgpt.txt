Transcript:
(00:00) in this video I'll show you how to make AI YouTube videos using chat GPT and descript storyboard welcome to this video my name is David and I hope you're well wherever you are around the world now let's get into the point we're going to be using chat GPT revolutionary you can use it to write your scripts and that's what we're going to do as our first step so right a YouTube script on five best places to visit in Kenya so I'm in Kenya makes sense to write a YouTube scripts on 5 best places to visit in Kenya maybe
(00:37) you want to create a faceless YouTube video for somebody or maybe to inform people who are going to be visiting your country so let's enter and let's have chat GPT give us a script that we can use as our Baseline so hello and welcome to our YouTube channel today we are going we are counting down to the top five places you need to visit on your trip to Kenya from stunning natural landscapes to vibrant cities and reach cultural experiences Kenya has something for everyone so let's get started it looks really good and you can see that
(01:10) we have number five on our list is Masai Mara number four is the city of Nairobi number three mompasa it's the coast looks good number two Mount Kenya and everything that we're seeing here looks really really good so we've got uh now number one is a great rift valley where we've got a ton of things that you can see uh lots of lakes lake baringo lake Bulgaria Lake Elementary Lake nakuru and so on and so forth so all these are places that you'd probably want to showcase to people so what we're
(01:46) going to do we're actually going to copy this whole script as it is just copy and then we're going to open up this script so the script storyboard is really really awesome and we're going to create a new project and once we click on that it's going to open up a new page for us to work on so we've got this page and uh we're going to click on start writing the reason why we're going to click on start writing is because we want to use the stock voices right inside the script so I'm going to paste my script right
(02:23) inside there and you'll see how it looks like it looks good and you can do whatever you want but now once we paste our script we don't have any voiceover down here so what we can do from here we can click on this speaker icon and then we can use stock voices if you have created a voice using the overdub feature that allows you to clone your voice you can also use your voice but for this we might try and look at what we can use so there are a couple of voices here so you can listen through life is like a camera just focus on
(02:58) whether that's done life is like a camera just focus on that's Emily life is like a camera let's see Malcolm life is like a camera just focus on what's important let's assume you want to use Malcolm but we have another couple of voices here that you can test out and see some of them for example dawn has like a feeling he you can add maybe angry Dawn so that you create a particular emotion in a particular section of a script but let's say we go with Don and once done is selected we should have
(03:34) some progress down here where we'll start the overdraft feature I will start kicking in so that we can actually create an audio file for us so you can see some few uh cuttings here it's downloading media 2.7 MB remaining because it's already generating our audio and uh it's still going on and you can zoom out to see how everything looks like uh let's see where we are and I believe we should be done with that so if I actually play this hello and welcome to our Channel today we're counting down the top five you've
(04:15) probably heard some of the videos like that uh on YouTube nah sometimes they may not be the best but you may need to do some few fine-tuning right inside here so the next thing that we're going to do is now get out of the right mode and go to the correct mode and this is where we're going to do everything that we need to do so we can come here and then say we want the video to be in landscape and once you do that what we're going to do now is we're going to make sure that we can add media to this so we're going
(04:46) to use the stock library inside the script storyboard so go to videos and then from here we can type maybe something like Safari if you're coming for Safari those are the different things that you may want to do now your internet connection uh may be a little bit better than mine so uh your videos May load a little bit faster you can scan through or hover over any of these uh to see what awaits you but let's say we just pick I just want to see what we can use let's actually use an image let's say we want a stock photo for
(05:25) Safari maybe something that is actually we go with this one so we can actually add this now let's actually Escape because the one thing that we might need to do is we might need to add something called scenes so we can add this here and that's a new scene we can add this here you can also click on the forward slash key to add different scenes and what this does is that it creates like sectioning of this particular uh steps that we have right here and let's just keep going because it helps us speed up
(06:01) our process in everything that we're doing so uh what chat GPT did for us is that it just gave us a quick breakdown and the good thing is that it actually paragraphed our places to visit in Kenya into different options here so we can go for this one uh this fast script here or scene in this section and then go back to images let's say we want to use this one looks good right there uh we can see how it looks like once it's done so here it is we can actually expand it to fill it to fill this particular
(06:40) section and then you can add a title let's say uh we can actually make it cups best places to visit in Kenya and then we can reduce the size to maybe something like uh let's say something like that so uh that looks good uh you can actually position it somewhere let's say maybe here and then we might we can actually decide to go with Roberto bold looks a little bit better and then you can actually go back and then play hello and welcome to our Channel today so what we are now going to do is just keep populating everything
(07:24) else here so we can actually just pick anything here uh let's say we go for videos and then for this next section we probably look for something that people will want to see let's say maybe go with this and it's going to download and add to a different sections that we have here so this may take a bit of time because it's a video and also depending on your internet connection the file has been added so if I go to the start hello and welcome to our Channel today we're counting down the top five places you
(07:59) need to visit on your trip to Kenya from stunning natural landscapes to vibrant cities and Rich cultural experiences Kenya has something for everyone so let's get started so you can actually add some clips right here so that you can intertwine or just create a different effects based on what is being mentioned uh all you need to do is just add some creativity we're actually just doing this uh to speed up the process let's say we look for Maasai Mara let's see if we have a clip on that uh hopefully there is one that we can use
(08:34) for these number five on our list or if we cannot get that let's say we go with Maasai we'll probably not miss actually okay there's no Maasai here uh let's see actually there's none let's say lions sorry my caps lock is on so I did not notice that and let's just give it a couple of seconds after that we see what we get uh and I think it might be easier to go for uh like uh images to make things easier here this looks good we can just pop it there then it's going to download for the
(09:14) different scenes or the scene that you've dragged it onto really really awesome and you can actually start from the beginning hello and welcome to our Channel today we're counting down the top five places you need to visit on your trip to Kenya from stunning natural landscapes to vibrant cities and Rich cultural experiences Kenya has something for everyone so let's get started number five on our list is the Maasai Mora National now you can add text and say maybe number one Masai Mara Etc really depends on what you want but let's try
(09:46) and just see if we can speed this up a little bit uh let's see we got Nairobi let's see if we have stock photos for Nairobi hopefully images uh there are no stock photos for Nairobi hopefully uh let's say we go for Kenya hopefully there is a photo for Kenya yeah uh there is this and it's famous for coffee wildlife and so on and so forth so you may need to look for a 404 City uh using even sites like specs pixels.
(10:20) com to add some more cities right there so you can actually just drop this here because that's a little bit smaller and then that's going to be added make sure that it fills in the way you want it to be and you're going you can mix it up and then we can go to the next scene where we go and look for something like uh Indian Ocean let's see if we have that so we've got a couple of things here so we can actually drag this to the coastal city of Mombasa uh as a representation of that because we've got marine life all done
(10:56) and so on and so forth so we can actually make sure that these fields in uh where we want it to fill in and then we've got uh let's see something like Mount Kenya let's see if we have that we don't have so we go for mountain and then we've got a couple of them just make sure that you get what depicts what you're looking for then we've got Mount Kenya here looks good and it's good for vacationing and so on and so forth but you can still use your own files that is videos and pictures so let's say you want to depict
(11:35) a mountain for example Mount Kenya you can also make some animations to these images if that's what you want and then the final part let's go and look if we have a rift valley I'm not sure I don't think so but let's say uh Flamingo because we've got like uh element title that has some good flamingos you can use that to depict that particular uh and then just drop it there and I've gone for the images because they're taking less time to download uh once we create them and so on and so forth so there we go the
(12:15) flamingos if you actually get some video of this would be really really awesome but it looks really good and then you can just go for maybe a summary of maybe uh Wildlife let's see what we get uh so let's see I'll be calling this one for the elephant drop it here so once we drop it there it's going to populate because it's an image uh but if you have good bandwidth you can test it out with videos and see what you get let's just expand it a little bit make sure it fills in and it looks really
(12:53) good so we can actually play this it's about a minute 40. and played hello and welcome to our Channel today we're counting down the top five places you need to visit on your trip to Kenya from stunning natural landscapes to vibrant cities and Rich cultural experiences Kenya so through in here you can actually throw in extra uh things like a good Beetle for a city uh different things landscape and so on and so forth so even adding your files you can add them to this section add them right here you can actually categorize
(13:26) them into folders so if you wanted to use chat GPT to brainstorm your script you can use that and then you can actually now come in here and populate your relevant content and create videos very very fast using the scripts overdub voices are really really awesome or even your own overdub clone of uh you've cloned your voice using overdub really awesome feature but once you're done so let's assume that we've got everything that we needed right here that our video is done is compiled you've added
(14:00) everything that is the headings maybe the images the b-roll and everything that you wanted then all we need to do is go to publish and then go to export and then as for the video you can check on the settings let's say we want 720p or maybe even 1080p but let's go with 720 let's just remove the metadata click on export and then set where you want it to be uh five places to visit in Kenya just click on Save and then it's going to start exporting your video and depending on the length of your video it may take a long or
(14:41) short time but hopefully this is not a big video per se and it tells us about two minutes remaining for this particular video to be done about a minute remaining so it seems it's recalculating what it mentioned uh depending on the fact that we used images in the last few sections here but for the first section uh it's because we used a video that's why it seemed to take a little bit more time but let's give it a couple of seconds and then we'll see the final result that we get from this particular feature combining
(15:16) chat GPT to write a script for us and then using the script and the overdub voices and then using the stock videos available but you can also use your own video so click on open and then we'll open the folder with the file just double click on it hello and this is what it looks like and Welcome to our Channel today we're counting down the top five places you need to it looks really really good but simply put that is how you can make AI YouTube videos using chat GPT and descript storyboard really simple and really awesome I hope
(15:50) this video is of value to you thank you so much for watching and until next time stay safe and never stop learning thanks for watching
