(00:00) in this video you'll see for yourself how to get your Tick Tock ad results to go from this to more like this by following a simple to execute five part formula and breaking one common rule that most gurus out there are spreading that actually holds most Tick Tock ads back there's this misconception out there but it's total garbage this is Matt Johnston and he knows what works with Tick Tock ads he's produced and overseen over 2 000 video ads that have generated well over 10 billion video views and millions of dollars in sales
(00:34) according to Matt and his data he's cracked The Tick Tock ad code with this exact strategy and that's not fluff he literally 10x disc click-through rates going from one half a percent all the way up to five percent and an overall five times return on ad spend as a direct result of the strategy and in under 15 minutes you'll have all the pieces in place to be able to replicate his results for yourself so Matt why get in on Tick Tock ads right now why not stick with Facebook ads or Instagram or YouTube Facebook ads definitely still
(01:07) work but they're getting tougher and they're really expensive the data is obviously awful because of iOS 14 and then the aftermath but also people are just sort of vacating the platform Google ads have always been expensive and YouTube ads are getting quite expensive so it's cheaper and more effective when you get in on it earlier right because Tick Tock will eventually be there as well but that makes this moment and probably for the next 18 months or so the moment to get there and it's sort of like a land grab at this
(01:41) time but it's a profitable landcraft and because I know some of you are thinking it no Tick Tock is not just a way to advertise to teenagers and people who still know who the musical guest on SNL is ladies and gentlemen Megan the stallion what the point is tick tocks users are aging up it might have been true if people were like it's just the kids but that's crap now everybody is on it I just got off a sales call that I booked through Tick Tock ads and this guy was 50 years old and ready to rock and roll
(02:13) most of the people that I have closed from Tick Tock have been over the age of 40. and that's not just Matt's experience the data backs him up here so 53 percent of tick tock's users are over 30 and that's just going to continue maturing over time so how can we get results like you get from ads on Tick Tock like what's your secret I think that there's this misconception out there that the best ad creative should be native to the platform you know that's some sort of like general rule
(02:44) but it's total garbage in fact it needs to be the opposite if you want to make a YouTube ad that has the best chance of converting you probably should shoot it like a selfie video because the rest of the content is extremely well shot with great depth of field and amazing cameras because that's what everybody's doing on YouTube so you get the opportunity to pattern out which is the most important thing you're going to hear that term a lot in the rest of this video so let's just Define it real quick so pattern
(03:11) interrupts are a scientific concept that come from neuro-linguistic programming and it just involves switching up a repetitive pattern to basically snap someone out of the days they're in since most people consume social media completely zoned out you need to shake them awake so to speak because it doesn't matter what you say in your ad if you don't pattern interrupt nobody will ever see it so on Tick Tock everybody came in that was trying out Tick-Tock ads at the beginning and we're still at the beginning saying that you
(03:40) got to make tick tocks you know the best thing is native so selfie type videos that look like ugc for lack of a better term and that's how you did Tick Tock ads but man that does not work I mean it may work for some but in my testing when I was first trying that regular tick tocks that simply had Direct response bent edited in tick tocks shot like tick tocks I was getting you know like 0.5.
(04:07) 6 click-through rates and I could not break through as soon as I started using this scripting methodology and some of the production stuff around it I'm looking at five percent click-through rates and I feel so confident in it like I feel like I've totally corrected at this point so how do you recommend shooting these ads if if not like standard organic tick tocks high production values not like you'll spend a bunch of money I'm saying use a good camera and have like the YouTube aesthetic you got to think like YouTuber
(04:36) like get a nice camera or figure out how to shoot with cinematic mode you know and like make it look good do stuff like depth of field lighting and stuff like that so it's clearly like like a normal Tick Tock it sticks out in the feed now to be clear here Matt isn't saying make it look like an ad either making something that looks like this or this is probably the worst thing you could do so he's only saying that you need to bump up the quality just enough so it stands out as people are scrolling now
(05:08) before we get to your five part Tick Tock ads formula what else can people do to help their ad interrupt the pattern and stand out like what are your ninja tricks like a couple of rules of the road make a cut every two seconds and switch the shot every two seconds so like I shoot in 4k and you literally just see me moving around like like you're playing up to the most add viewer you can the other thing that I do and this is just like from analyzing viral tick tockers and seeing what they did I add what I I call personality hits in it
(05:37) which basically means every 10 to 12 seconds I'll like cut really fast to like some crazy sound effect and piece of b-roll and it's like one second long but it breaks it up and it pattern interrupts so it's not just this person talking to camera all the time it's very important that you edit them in this specific way that is just constantly pattern interrupting like never stop watching this video because there's always something new to look at right you can't take your eyes off of it
(06:08) another hack is I screw with audio like my my most successful ad ever I whisper at the beginning because remember they auto play in the feed and nobody's Whispering so so when you get to my ad it said did you know there's a high demand skill way and I'm saying it right into the mic and everybody stops and of course I get a lot of comments on it but it's it works you know like it hooks people in because it's inherently different from everything else they're just thumb scrolling through awesome so
(06:34) what's the form formula that you've been using look like so essentially the script formula is the five T's so T is a secret tell a story Turning Point teach and transition so Tick Tock will even tell you that shorter ads perform better I have not found this to be true I've found that longer ads are better and I always make my ads a minimum because that's the max that you can do right now but I go through the whole thing so at the beginning tease a secret I've always held the tick tock and YouTuber actually
(07:01) like super similar in weird ways because both of their algorithms prioritize watch time and video completions and the same thing goes with ads you tease a secret to get somebody in the door so that they're gonna watch the whole thing you're not trying to like disqualify people or anything it's just like did you know that there's a secret way to do XYZ in fact if you're trying to get your first Tick Tock ad off the ground I would just say exactly that like I would pick your avatar what is their dream
(07:29) desired result did you know there's a secret way to get insert desired result in x amount of time tell a story so this is where you're going to sort of like tell a mini story of the empathetic pain point that your product or whatever you're selling solves let's just say you're trying to teach people how to grow a YouTube channel okay so you're trying to grow a YouTube channel you might say three years ago I started my YouTube channel nobody watched anything every single day I would open up YouTube
(07:59) studio and I would be like why am I putting this much work into it threw my phone across the room I went to my wife and I was like this is not worth it I'm gonna have to give up on this and I almost gave up right so that emotional empathetic story that everybody's starting a YouTube channel feels and then you have turning point which is but then I discovered right insert unique mechanism of the way that you help people achieve the results and then teach because again this is similar to what I would do on YouTube ads actually
(08:27) this sort of format people on YouTube expect to be taught and actually people on Tick Tock kind of expect to be taught because there's just such a the pervasiveness of like listicle videos and everything on tick tocks I can't tend to sort of narrow down the unique solution into like three very quick value points like step one do this step two do this step three do this and then transition is just simply the call to action you know like if you want to know more about this click below let's switch
(08:53) gears for a second and talk about targeting so how do you choose the Right audience to show these ads to on Tick Tock oh this is great did you know that there have been some really fascinating reports lately about how Tick Tock is becoming like these search engine of record for Gen Z like that's freaking crazy because you're talking about a future and a present honestly where you can essentially do intent based advertising this is something that Facebook chased forever and they could never do there was a time I don't know
(09:27) if you remember but there was a time when Facebook was trying to like push search like they were trying to get everybody to search for things and it was even a targeting option at one point but it never took off but gen Z which by the way gen z's are not that young anymore right I mean are people up to 30 searching at it too yeah most likely what do you mean like they're searching for Stuff within the app I'm talking about the way you'd use Google like going to tick tock and search for how to
(09:55) get out a red wine stain and see what you get you know like really intent based stuff and like when I started discovering that it blew my mind because we've always been chasing Google and YouTube for intent based advertising forever because you can't do that in Facebook it's just Interruption marketing like get in front of me and get my thing and we have to convince you but what if we found a new platform to actually show an ad to somebody who's searching for exactly what you do and if you don't have any good intent based
(10:27) audiences should you just leave it wide open like they say you should do with Facebook ads these days I think my best advice would Target eating is be really Civic with it like rather than broad the algorithm is still really dumb so you got to tell it what to do that's very good about age if your problem with getting into Tick Tock is because of the age group I mean you just you can just eliminate them and there's plenty of fish in the sea and yeah it's very good about geographical area now there are
