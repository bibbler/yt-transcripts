Transcript:
(00:00) guys hope you're doing good so if you're watching this video that I promise you that today is about to be a special day for you uh less of a special day for me because I'm actually going to be losing money but it is what it is for the sake of dropping bangers after bangers and valuable insights uh to people out there trying to scale their businesses you know you got to lose out in the short term okay but um in order for me to tell you why today is about to be special they actually have to take you back and
(00:28) give you a bit more context and you know share with you a story right but for those who don't know me my name is Serge katari I'm a client acquisition.io it's a and it's a company that makes it unreasonable for people running service-based businesses agencies Consulting uh you know High ticket Consulting businesses not to scale pass 50k or 100K per month okay and the way we do it is we build uh offers where we find offers where we find sales arguments we build outbound campaigns so we can generate more meanings and we
(00:56) also build appointment setting teams for you so you can be removed from the process of sending meetings right so we kind of like take care of everything that would keep you from not you know generating meanings not generating sales okay and um eight months ago I had a client who you know joined our program and helped him introduce a new offer and from the day he started to push the offer to uh seven from seven weeks from the day he started to push that offer seven weeks later he had scaled to sixty thousand dollars a month okay
(01:30) I have never experienced such a fast growth especially if you're not relying on a lot of AD spend um and when I saw that growth I was like whoa whoa whoa this is an anomaly there is something here right so what I did to try to prove that this could actually be a good thing is I started helping a lot more clients introduce the same offer to you know what uh the client was pushing because at the end of the day I want more of my clients to succeed right and that offer was you know the offer that we were pushing was kind of related to
(02:01) tick tock you know offers ugcs all that good stuff right and uh you know the next client who introduced it went from 5 to 10K a month to 25k a month a few months later right another client went from 7K a month to 50k a month in four months in less than four months right and these are not necessarily clients who just got like just got started in the game right these are people who had previously been in the game for a year or so but have never been able to scale past 10K a month right so um after having like five clients at a
(02:33) combined total I mean of new ARR of like around 2 million 2 million to three million dollars and like less than five months I was like whoa this is insane right so what I decided to do is uh I come we created a training around everything that we've learned uh in the last six months or so around launching uh new offers related to Tick Tock but not necessarily just Tick Tock itself but just uh the overall like Trends going on in the marketplace right now right and the whole um the whole reason behind the the reasoning behind the
(03:08) training was how can you scale fast all right by giving the market what the market wants right that's my whole thing I like to give people what they want and then once I have Capital then I like to go and solve the bigger problems right so I designed this training uh I shouldn't really be releasing this training not just because it has made me money but because of the amount of value and insights that we shared in this training right would have generally did not hold anything back and when I say wheat I mean it was me my clients and
(03:38) our partners on that webinar we were sharing everything right we shared the top three reading offers the client acquisition infrastructure the Outreach workflow how we're booking 25 50 to 100 meetings plus per month the service delivery right if you're pushing Tech talk right now then you know that the hardest part is not actually how to get clients it's actually how do you actually fulfill right we sold that onboarding project management systems clients literally shared their screen um and showed us everything all the
(04:07) systems that they have right we went over the demo in sales call structure so you know how to sell we went over ugc packages so you're pushing out ugc offers then we're going over how to package it and price it so you can actually make a profit out of it and at the end of the webinar I also shared our proprietary scaling blueprint and client acquisition infrastructure that we actually built in our clients companies right so I shared what we do at the end of the training and uh yeah now for the next normally you actually have to pay
(04:39) to access this training but from the 26th uh for the next five days I've actually decided that I want to release it for free all right not because not because I'm an angel but because I generally think that the only way for people to to work with us is if they're actually at a point where they're earning money right so I was like well why would I keep information from people who could potentially become clients why don't I give it away for free right now I'm not going to extend it and keep it
(05:08) for free for longer than five for five days because I genuinely don't want to create that much competition for our clients so I generally want to Advocate to an obstacle to keeping people outside from getting the training right but for the next five days it's free I'm gonna be releasing a training um for after this once the once this part ends this segment I'm going to be releasing the 36 first minutes of that three hour training right the training is three hours but I'm going to be releasing
(05:39) um the first 36 minutes so you can see what it's like and get a little bit of value now if you want to access it you're going to have a link below that you have to go and opt in and actually receive the full training right it's on a portal portal so you're going to have to opt in and get you can create your users and stuff like that but um yeah find it helpful um I think it's worth three hours of your life guys it's generally everything okay the price will be going from 299 to 4.99 after these next five days so if
(06:10) you don't get it while it's free then please understand that you're going to have to pay 500 bucks to access it okay so uh that's pretty much it again Watch the first 36 minutes and then if you want to get more uh click the link below opt-in and um get the training okay thank you so much have an amazing time consuming the content bye-bye all right so um my the goal with today's session is to um you know in the last few months we've started this thing around introducing Tick Tock offers for a lot of our
(06:45) clients and and to be honest it's been life-changing not just for me but for some of my clients too right and uh my goal I've never really been one to sell information so every time that I do these live sessions the goal with them is to literally give away everything that we're that we are currently leveraging to actually scale our customers right we're not necessarily here to sell courses we're here to actually sell infrastructures and implementation so that for anyone who literally desires success or at least
(07:17) financial success can can be able to leverage the stuff that we're going to be sharing um to you know actually take action and to be able to to get ahead in life right and I do this because I would have personally loved to have someone who's because you know when you're starting out you don't necessarily have all the budget in the world and you have other things that you have to pay for so you know maybe getting actual specific knowledge can be the thing that helps you um you know move forward without having
(07:48) any obstacle uh the only thing I would ask you guys to do is just put your screen on if you're on the zoom uh there's no reason to be like to not be showing your face um you know it's like how you expect to make a million with no camera so that's that would be a little tricky right and I want to also know who you are right um if I don't know who you are if I have never seen your face then it's hard for me to oh come on now so it's my birthday so might get a little bit of once I can meet
(08:31) sorry it's my aunt calling me one second go offline um all right shall we get started uh only thing before we get started only thing I'd like to ask you guys to do is uh be respectful uh wish me happy birthday in the comments okay because I I should be out somewhere out there drinking like tequila or something like that right um and um what I'd like you guys to do this is not I'm not necessarily going to force you guys to do it but if you can please make a story on Instagram Facebook or whichever platform you're on
(09:04) maybe even a post and uh take a picture of this and then tag me uh tag my name so Serge katari and Clan acquisition.io and uh just right besides it 50k a month Tick Tock agency right that's all you guys have to do because today's session is about to be amazing uh it's not actually going to be just me presenting today it's going to have Chris um who's a customer who's you know scaled his agency who's going to be presenting I have Koopa who's going to be presenting I have also Ashley who are
(09:35) both uh Partners uh and who help with fulfillment for our clients okay so um I'm not necessarily an expert in all areas so I'm going to let those who are in the game solving specific issues uh do the sharing of knowledge okay so um yeah but before we get started I just need them stories I need them tags on Instagram guys I need you guys to run it up okay cool um I think I think we can think we can get started did I forget anything I don't think I did all right nice to see everyone here I see a lot of beautiful faces I see a lot
(10:15) of names so I don't know if you guys are beautiful or not we'll never know all right cool so um in today's session uh I want to go over you know everything you guys uh would need to know to make it unreasonable for you not to have a 50k a month Tick Tock agency in four months or less the reason why I'm saying for a month or less is not because I just like oh I just want to make a big claim and just put out four months no it's literally we've had multiple clients literally scale to 50K a month or more
(10:45) in four months or less okay so this is from Pure facts okay uh so for those who don't know me my name is Serge katari are on Clan acquisition.io it's a consultancy slash agency where we build uh people's offers we build client acquisition systems uh we build we hire and train growth teams for you and we take care we'll help you take care of fulfillment at least when it comes to this uh Tick Tock um angle of uh of our service okay so why should you listen to anything I say um so I quit my job in 2020 July
(11:19) beginning of July so it's been two years but a year later I started client acquisition at IO scaled it to over two mil in annual recurring uh Revenue in 10 months I think we had our biggest Month in May which was 187 thousand dollars collected in less than 30 days um can we consult and we've built client acquisition infrastructures for over 400 agencies as well as high ticketing for businesses of course uh we manage over a hundred album campaigns for agencies how to get in for business and know what
(11:52) works and what doesn't Okay the the difference between people who sell courses and like our business is that uh like we're in the trenches every single day with um like with our customers right we have I mean I could show you guys but I could show you guys what we do but it would take a whole day to do it so I'm not going to go get into it so so yeah we're in the trenches we do Outreach ourselves we book around 300 meetings every single month from um you know just to album okay um reg who's um our operation uh you know
(12:30) manager who takes care of some of the the appointment setting process I suppose also takes care of our accounting um recently the p l uh of our first year in business so we crossed a million dollars and um we've had I was looking at this profit and loss statement and I realized that we've only had um six thousand dollars Seven Grand in refunds which was from like two clients and then over a million dollars collected in the last um in the last year the last 12 months right and the reason why I pointed this
(13:03) out is because in order to achieve a refund rate this low guys like I mean I I would I would love to have someone show me a refund rate this low who's on this call we have 100 people on this call so um if you can and praise you and I'll probably sign up for your services right now right but uh you need an amazing service and we have built that amazing service and experience for our customers okay and you know pretty profitable too so hopefully you guys can pay attention to what I'm going to say um so why is uh why is Tick Tock why is
(13:39) starting a tick tock offer uh the best vehicle to jump in right now okay so a lot of you guys um so I when I say tick tock agency I'm not necessarily saying that the only way to make money with Tick Tock is to be running an agency that's not actually the case what you guys will see in this presentation is that I'm actually going to be breaking down a few offers that are also in the Consulting space so you don't necessarily need an agency you don't need creators you don't need this and
(14:04) that to actually make money with this offer right so but the number one reason why um I personally think the real like the reason why most of our customers are succeeding is probably of course you know it's a little bit because of the help we help them with client acquisition infrastructures but the number one reason why it's so easy to win with this offer is because it's trendy right a few months ago I was listening to her Moses YouTube video where he shared a story about his friends about a friend's
(14:37) realization of how important Trends are right so the story goes like this uh I think it was an entrepreneur I think it's probably done over nine figures the guy that he was talking about and um his friend essentially what he ended up realizing was that um or what the friend told her mostly was that you know when I was winning you know back in my days is that I thought I was actually an amazing entrepreneur right he thought he was a beast he thought he was everything that he was winning out was because of how good he
(15:07) is of how good he's making our decisions of how smart he was of how good the systems I have built where but feet looking back a few decades you know looking back a few decades what he ended up realizing was that every time that he was winning was because there was a trend that actually made it easier for him to win right he ended up realizing that every single win so as an example um if I look at our own success and with Khan acquisition at IO uh you know we went from making like eighty seven thousand dollars a month to making a
(15:42) hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars the next month right now the me who's egotistical would probably be like oh my God Serge you're such an amazing entrepreneur you're such a shark oh my God you should probably go and buy another car at this month right but do you know what I did not do that I was like hey guys we got lucky we're in a Trend and you know what I'ma run it until I make a million a month okay so the number one thing guys like I I could even end this webinar here right now
(16:14) if you guys just understand this lesson I personally think you guys can make it unreasonable for you not to for to not be making as much money as you want right maybe you want to just be making 20K a month cool that's good maybe you want to be making 100K profit every month that's cool but the way you do it is leverage Trends okay and definition of a trend is a prevailing tendency or inclination towards something okay in this case it's tick tock anything related to tick tock really right tick tock ads Tick Tock you know ugcs
(16:47) whatever it doesn't matter right there is a prevailing tendency right now in the marketplace for this mechanism okay and success is much more effortless or is is is effortless when the market actually wants what you're selling okay we can even look back at our my for at my first business success which was appointment setting which is still one of the reasons why most people work with us um I ended up realizing that like you know why am I trying to start a an advertising agency when I figure out how to book meetings and I know how painful
(17:18) it was for me to you know not be able to book meetings so I started selling appointment setting services and uh of course I leverage a trend because there are so many business owners getting created online so all of them need meaning so I was like oh my God this is also a trend right and I scaled it to 30k a month in in four months or less right now uh imagine to understand what you know what what kind of like impact that Trend can have uh on your business imagine starting a Facebook Ad Agency in 2014 versus starting one in
(17:51) 2022. right how many people in this in this webinar the hundreds of people we have how many people have tried running and scaling a Facebook Ad Agency but can hardly get any meanings can you live a chat in the a message in the chat below thank you we've all been there I know I know everyone like it's crazy right but um but you know and the fact is Facebook is not necessarily like of course it might be a little worse but Facebook is still an amazing platform to actually advertise on right but if you tried
(18:34) selling it to the marketplace you would literally grow old before you make money right and it's not even because the service or the product is bad it's just because the market has become numb to the actual thing right now when you compare it to tick tock people it's something new people don't really understand the platform they're starting to understand a little bit more but there's a huge um you know chunk of the market that has not yet um that is not up to date okay so and uh the second thing is it's easy to
(19:03) understand once you understand the winning content framework to be honest for me I think that the most the hardest part around tick tock is content because everything else media buying advertising finding creators this is this is easy this is stuff that you know you could learn on YouTube in two seconds this you can also learn on YouTube in a few seconds but um but like content knowing how to design them you know all this good stuff is what's going to keep most people from not really being able to fulfill for
(19:31) their clients okay now uh the third thing is that you know the success rate is through the roof right the average growth of uh that our clients sees let's say five to tenk a month and your Revenue every 45 days but clients that have launched this new tick tock offer and acquisition systems uh you know are adding 10 to 20K per month and literally like like because some will do it in less than a month right in like a few weeks right of course how how Chris I know you've gone from like uh I know you're around 20K per month right
(20:06) now can you let people know what's the time frame that you actually closed those three Deals that got you those 20K a month yeah for sure it was like uh what three weeks ago two weeks ago four meetings forecloses this is two seven figure Brands two other brands doing like 50k 100K in Rev nice and and can you compare that to how many calls you got with before you actually started pushing this thing I list the new more thorough offer that you have today how many meetings did you actually book before yeah prior I'll say
(20:39) I was averaging what like one to five meetings a month now with this offer booking five to ten means a week and more so like pumping up the numbers now it's like doubling just because all right this offer is killing me man yeah so so yeah so three weeks zero to twenty can a month right no money spent on ads well most agencies to be honest will take two years three years five years uh maybe some will never achieve this 100K a month Mark right our customers are doing it in six months which is actually for me personally it's actually pretty
(21:11) insane um so yeah you can you can try to start or scale a Facebook Ad Agency or an email marketing offer or a cro or any other service but we will take you a year or more to make 100K a month right now am I saying that these other offers don't work that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that they're not trending so you're going to have to do a lot more effort you're going to find an uphill battle to actually make money okay that's it I'm sure you guys have seen uh the case of the test the case
(21:39) study from Amar uh he went from 0 to 60k a month instead of seven weeks which was actually scary uh and then I think right now he's um around 100 150k a month right um he did it in like the first five months of launching his offer right um Amar had previously scaled a Facebook Ad Agency to 25k a month but things collapsed in June July of 2021 due to the iOS 14 update he thought of ditching Facebook ads and started uh starting email marketing um uh email marketing offer even try launching a Snapchat offer actually but
(22:13) things didn't work out uh it felt like he had a job because he was always like finding to get all things done because it was like a one-man show right after joining the program Amara launched a new tick tock offer with his partner Clan acquisition started in February of 2022 by end of March they were already doing 60k a month right just mind-blowing now who is this for um so I personally think this this this thing is going to be for two people right maybe it's for you if you're just maybe starting out and need slash want
(22:46) to start with a winning offer you have no desire in wanting to achieve and live the life that you want to be living no way you have no desire in waiting to achieve uh and live the life that you want to be living okay most people make the mistake to try and figure out everything by themselves and they end up wasting two to five years of their life when these could have been two to five years of being free financially uh while you're making 20K 50k 100K a month right the old thing of like hey you know you
(23:16) need to get rich slow yeah let's keep let's let that for the people who are you know who are okay with the you know dying broke uh now the second person that this would be for is you're already running a successful agency or an online service business uh making anywhere between 20K to 100K per month but you're starting to realize that there's way too much resistance when you're trying to sell your parents Services it's getting harder and harder for you to sign more clients uh or to sign at least more than
(23:43) five four to five clients per month right and then you have people you know you're seeing so and so launch their Tick Tock offer and scale ridiculously fast and you don't want to be left behind because you decided not to play the game okay so this is really it maybe you know you know maybe you're starting out maybe you're just going through a course and you're stuck you're like oh my God you know this guy sold me a Facebook Ad Agency I don't know if this is the one right thing uh you know
(24:07) should I go to tick tock yeah go to tick tock okay the second thing is I know people right now who are making actually good money right even I'm to a point that sometimes I'm like yo should I start a tick tock agency right uh like that that bad right because it's so easy like when I see customers winning right uh now what are we going to be covering today's training I'm going to be covering a few winning offers I'm going to be covering our client acquisition infrastructure I'm going to be uh I'm
(24:35) not going to be doing it but um Chris is going to be going in over Service delivery infrastructure uh Koopa is going to be going over demo and sales call process and Ashley is going to be going over ugc packages and how you can make a profit from them and then we're going to end with some q and A's okay staying till the end we'll guarantee that you know everything that you need to succeed in scaling a tick tock agency past 50k a month okay now winning offers I'm going to start with the first one
(25:02) and this is the easiest one by the way okay and this is personally this is what I prefer I I love this offer now of course it's an easy offer meaning a lot of people can compete with you but uh if you have authority online you always get to take 80 of the market even if other people can do the same thing as you right as an example how many people do you guys know that do appointment setting how many do you think are doing um 150 Grand a month not many right some people can't even scale past 20K a month with their
(25:32) appointment setting agencies right but we're able to scale plus you know almost multiple six figure a month because uh you know we're kind of built like a name for ourselves right so if you want to beat competition build a name for yourself right we can talk about that another day that's not the topic for today right but the first offer is sure firm content creation and distribution offer right what I mean by that is you go and partner with someone maybe a consultant maybe a coach maybe a real estate agent maybe
(26:05) um maybe a brand or maybe a SAS business uh like doesn't matter right anyone who feels like they could build a they need to build an audience in order to make more money and then you're like hey just shoot this content maybe give them this content structure and then they shoot it and then they send it to you and then you just chop it up and then add some captions some subtitles and then you uh distribute it for it for them on tick tock on Instagram reels and Facebook reels as well as shorts okay now a lot of people don't really understand
(26:38) why people would want this Market uh or why why the market wants this offer and even worse most people don't actually understand the sales angle that you should leverage trying to sell this service okay you see you know what I see so I get around three pitches five pitches a week with people who have launched this offer and I rarely ever showed them any of my attention right because they lack the right angle to sell me this offer right most of them are like hey Serge uh give me some of your content I'll uh I'll I'll chop it off
(27:15) for you for free I'm like I don't want free I want an amazing service and I want you to tell me why this would be amazing for me okay now in order for me to explain why um the actual sales angle you guys should use to sell this offer let me share with you guys a short like uh like podcast segment that was pretty pretty important when I actually heard it right this is the first time that I learned about Canal shop I've never heard of him but when I heard him say this I was like oh my God who is this
(27:46) guy right and apparently he owns a 800 million dollar company so anyone who's built an 800 million dollar company it probably has something to teach you about business okay so the whole angle of this offer is that you should be selling social status it has nothing to do with Distributing content like nobody cares about reels nobody cares about tech talks right but let me let uh Canal shot explain it okay yeah by the way if you guys don't check out this uh podcast knowledge project then you should probably you probably
(28:19) know that you're broke okay but let's keep going but check this out and let's believe this is true now products and services is example of like just imagine this let's say all of us are on some level of social status in life let's let's say Shane you are at level 90 I'm at level 60 somebody is at level 200 and so on and so forth unless I believe this is true now perhaps and services are also at some levels in life for example I would say Louis Vuitton is a level 160 uh uh HBS education is at
(28:56) level 200 and let this imagine these things and there's a fuel in your car in the level Gerty and so on and so forth by designing those margins exist when you allow human beings to jump their social status and gross margins disappear when you do not help them increase their social status for example I will keep moving to a utility provider as long as they keep offering me lower price as long as the time required and the effort required is the same because the department of your brain that deals with that is the CFO of the
(29:31) brain who's only looking for Cost Cuts but the CMO of your brain is saying that oh my God if I crack HBS and I will be able to jump the social status and my income will multiple and therefore it is okay to spend years time money to get a chance to get into Ivy League and therefore I really can keep increasing the gross margin with no trouble because they promise or even if they give you hope let's give example of Vegas right now Vegas does not assure you you become rich but we hope Lottery uh which is a chance of
(30:09) being level 30 jump into level 200 I'm okay to go all in once in a while especially poor people get sucked into that a lot more because imagine it's like being on a poker table to the smallest staff the best strategy you feel to be on the table is to go all in all the time so then we went to pandemic I believe that the whole world had this amygdala hijacked moment where that all right so um let me try to explain this in uh in other words so um what what essentially Canal is saying is that in life we're born at a certain
(30:46) level right we're probably born at zero right and then you have to get to level a thousand and you know let's say like social status wise right there's level a thousand and that's where everyone wants to get to okay now every business or not every business really a lot of businesses just sell products for black utility meaning oh you want me to be like to to wash your windows cool I don't want to do it so this is utility just do it for me okay but the businesses that make the most amount of
(31:16) money are businesses that don't actually offer utility right as an example um you know the other day I went to I went to Miami and I was just like yo maybe I've never really bought anything expensive or when it comes to like designer or stuff like that so I went to uh to Yves Saint Laurent and um I saw these glasses I was like oh this is these are really nice right I didn't really check the price I just said hey yeah you know just give me give me the classes right it ended up being like 700 bucks 800 bucks right now
(31:46) if you try to ask me for 800 bucks to what what is the utility thing that I would want done if you tried asking me for um 800 bucks to I don't know to like clean my house I'd be like are you mad I'd be like it doesn't make sense right but glasses like sunglasses that have no utility just literally they're just sitting there I don't probably won't even wear them much I was willing to pay 700 bucks without even thinking twice right so the thing with this Tick Tock content offer is that when you're trying to sell
(32:23) it you're not going to be saying hey I'm going to redistribute 20 30 pieces of content every month you're gonna get uh 500 views on each or a thousand views no no no no no stop that nobody cares about that what people care about is where are you going to bring me social status wise right so the angle that you used to sell it is you're going to be like hey I'm going to make you the number one go-to person in your industry I'm going to get you more known than Alex vermozi right I'm gonna because a lot of people
(32:52) actually believe that they have an amazing service but they're not known so people have no respect for them right so the angle that you use is forget the mechanism like forget the features nobody care oh my God guys nobody cares right what people care about is can you sell me something that makes me go up in Social Status right as an example let's say you go to a university somewhere in your in your neighborhood or somewhere in any city in the world and they're like hey it costs 20 000 a year to go to you're going to be like oh
(33:22) my God there's so much so much money right but then you go to Harvard and let's say it's 100 Grand or 200 Grand or half a million right and do you know what people are like oh my God it's so cheap not because Harvard has better teachers not because Harvard has better knowledge I mean it's Universal knowledge it's not like it's something new right but just to have the fact that you went to Harvard takes you from Level zero to level 500 in society that's what people buy that's what people buy nice cars that's
(33:57) why people fly private that's why people go to the club spend thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars on alcohol guys do you guys get the point like it's stupid what people do for money right so status is the thing or so okay we don't sell any more features right if you guys doing our program I'm not selling you guys 50k a month I'm selling you guys what comes with 50 camera okay so is it clear is it clear now on why um yeah I don't even think it's selling Futures guys it's literally selling the
(34:33) core basic people want to be people want approval from others people want to be considered people want to feel feel good right and you need uh you need to be known you need to have people know you for who you are and uh respect you for that so yeah that's why you know that's why most people do everything okay so um and then guess what anyone who's competing with feature like utility businesses so an example like paid ads agencies uh let's say you're like oh I'm uh I'm gonna run ads for you I'm gonna
(35:05) get you a 5x return okay and then you have another agency who's like hey I'm gonna get you a 5x return and if I can't get it I'm gonna give you five thousand dollars right what ends up happening with businesses like like like like you know people who run advertising agencies is that they're providing utility right and when what happens is that the market will always go to the person who could delivers utility at the cheapest cost right because if I have someone who's saying like hey I can do the same thing
(35:33) that he's promised you to do for half the price well I'm gonna go with that person right unless that person is actually offering me status maybe it's someone who's famous and just by working with them I'm gonna like go up a level right or being friends with him right um but what ends up happening with agencies that sell utility is that their gross margins literally disappear I swear to God I cannot tell you how many ads I see from agency owners saying hey I'll do this for free and if I can do it
(36:03) for free I'll actually even pay you at this point I'm like guys how do you even make your money boss how can your agency make money it doesn't make sense you're promising it's like stop competing on price level up your status and make sure that people come to you and they're willing to pay 10 times what they would pay for the same thing elsewhere guys you gotta stop competing on price that's mod why is our program 15 grand because because I don't want to be competing with other broke boys out
(36:32) there who's trying to sell you like Outreach or va's for a thousand or two thousand bucks that's crazy what you get here is something completely different okay but anyway this is an important point for me to make because I I you know once you understand it it can help you out a lot okay so you're selling X person and why Niche to jump to the Toppers one percent of their industry by leveraging a Content machine and leveraging the virality of The Tick Tock or you know just these social short form
(37:00) content algorithms okay because it's really easy to actually blow up right I had a tick tock of mine go to like 200 000 views and I had to like you know I had the whole continent of Africa dming me every day asking me to teach them how to make money you know when I go to Ronda I'll probably have like like maybe 20 000 girlfriends waiting for me I'm joking but no guys like it it can really you know you can really go viral a lot okay so the opportunity cost now let me also explain to you guys uh because a lot of people have the
(37:32) objection of oh why wouldn't someone why wouldn't why wouldn't surge go and hire someone an editor from I don't know from the Philippines from somewhere in Mexico to do it for like 500 bucks to a thousand bucks a month well let me show you okay well the truth is someone can definitely I can definitely go I actually have someone uh an editor from the Philippines that I pay 500 bucks but you know what I'm still paying more money to someone else to added other pieces of content right but um why wouldn't someone edit the content
(38:01) themselves that's also another objection right well let's say client acquisition Revenue in the last 28 days has been 157 000 okay let's say I work 30 hours a week that's 120 hours a month that if you divide that by number of work I probably let's say make 100 1.3 K an hour okay now if I was to edit my own content it would become costing me a thousand dollars per hour that I edit the content right and it would probably take me three hours a month to do it right so we probably end up costing me
(38:30) like almost like four grand to do it right so why would I in the like one in what world would it make sense for me to edit my content myself when I can get someone to do it for 1.5k 2.5 k then spend 10 to 20 hours a month doing it okay so that's why most people will not do it themselves or they will not even go find uh someone to even hire right they'd rather have it done for people who are making money they want done okay Leilani's launched this offer uh she's a girl who jumped in a program a
(39:02) few months ago went through a course then to see success and uh when she jumped in our office she first started launching tried launching a Ecom offer Tick Tock offer but I was like hey uh you're just getting started Ecom can be a little tricky so why don't you launch this uh this Tick Tock um this Tick Tock content offer and a few days later she signed her first client 2.
(39:27) 5 k uh and yeah easy money she's she and she's you know she just got started it was probably like her her second sales call ever right uh and then this can also be the content offer right A lot of people say oh but you know content doesn't deliver outcome content doesn't deliver Roi well that's if you stop at this first level okay so most people who are pushing this content offer will do this right they'll be like hey I'll do B2B content creation to talk wheels for mostly Style videos uh I'll do content topics editing I'll add this
(39:56) subtitles I'll chop it up whatever and then I'll consistently post on your page uh five to seven days a week okay and then they find a contractor who's good at editing the thing uh and then use the biggest personal Brands uh in the niches your case studies right to try to sell it but if you really want to become a beast at this offer what you do is you actually go a step further right and you actually help that person your client convert that new audience into money okay so an example of an of a headline
(40:27) could be hey I'll make it unreasonable for a real estate agent struggling to get known scale their personal brand and falling past 50 000 followers by leveraging Tick Tock you know whatever The Tick Tock mechanism can be in six months or less right so as an example uh you can easily get 2 000 views on every other reel that you post right and from there that real estate agent is probably going to be getting around 100 followers at the lowest to 500 followers per week every single week okay now what ends up happening is that you if
(40:58) you're smart if you know how to run acquisition is you would build a Facebook group and call it home buyers and sellers insights right how to sell your home for three times the price create a Facebook group for that embed the link on their Tick Tock and their Instagram you add a few questions to qualify everyone who joins the Facebook group okay and then you hire a virtual assistant to uh to start conversation with everyone who joins that group and you um try to book them on a meeting hey do you have a homie that you need to
(41:28) sell oh you don't have a home would you be interested in having um and selling a home in the next or buying a home in the next few months okay so now you've grown Their audience but you've actually also built a converting Mac a conversion mechanism and now the person cannot fire you right this is how you can go from charging two thousand dollars to charging five ten Grand a month right so this is the the first offer is it clear is it clear my people foreign Perfect all right now let's go to the
(42:11) next one this next one is pretty straightforward guys um paid ads and ugcs to Ecom or B2B most of our clients are pushing this offering it's pretty straightforward solve the biggest bottleneck of these for these companies which is user generated content creation and distribution at scale adding a little bit of advertising on Tick Tock right pair it with Facebook don't forget that Facebook is going to need to be included with your offer guys because Tick Tock is not as a great AdWords targeting as Facebook
(42:38) so um make sure you include it right but don't go in and saying hey I'll do Facebook ad for you no way they'll not even pay attention to you right sell them what they want and then give them what they need okay
